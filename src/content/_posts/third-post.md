### Stretch

- Explore adding sounds to the interactions
- Use CSS transform/transition animations instead of framer-motion
- Create a cuter SVG heart shape perhaps using figma
- Debounce the POST request if a user clicks rapidly
- Move to a database the works well with serverless. Pretty sure I will hit database connection limits on Heroku's free tier.

### Conclusion

Not quite Josh Comeau level, but I had fun nonetheless. **Comparing my solution** to Josh's really shows how you can keep pushing even the most simple UI elements to the next level until they are a joy and delight to use.

P.s. If you have any ideas of what UI element I can tackle next for my 30 day challenge let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira).

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/delbaoliveira/website/blob/main/ui/LikeButton.tsx) and... if you liked this post. Give it a like (or 3) ðŸ™ƒ
